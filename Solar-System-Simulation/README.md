# 3D-Solar-System-Simulation

This is more like a 3 dimensional view of solar systems which have some cool features like following the planets and their satilights etc.. I have used Unity 3D to achive this. This is just to get introduced to 3D world of Unity with basic functionalities and enhancements.

In order to access the 3D world follow "Build" --> "WebGL" --> "Index.html"

Open for ideas ;)
